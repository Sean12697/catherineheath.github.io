This one time, at band camp, I put in about 2-3 cups of water into a kettle so that myself and some friends could make a hot drink. After the kettle was boiled, my friend came in, tossed all that water down the sink, filled it to the top and put the kettle on again. I was so in shock I couldn't contain the laughter inside of me.
